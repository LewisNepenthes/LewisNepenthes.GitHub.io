Date: 2004-08-30. Last updated: 2019-10-16.</p><p>This page discuss why Donald Knuth’s TeX (and LaTeX) is a bad technology.</p><h2 id="TeX-—-the-Grand-Daddy-of-Syntax-Soup-—-Worse-Than-C-sprintf"><a href="#TeX-—-the-Grand-Daddy-of-Syntax-Soup-—-Worse-Than-C-sprintf" class="headerlink" title="TeX — the Grand Daddy of Syntax Soup — Worse Than C sprintf"></a>TeX — the Grand Daddy of Syntax Soup — Worse Than C sprintf</h2><p>To create these formulas:</p><p><img src="http://xahlee.info/math/i/math_formula_MathJax.png" alt="math formula MathJax"></p><p>Math formulas rendered in TeX</p><p>Here’s what you have to write:</p><pre><code>\\sum\_{n=1}^k \\frac{1}{n} ≻ \\int\_1^{k+1} \\frac{1}{x} dx = \\ln(k+1)\\sum\_{n = 0}^\\infty \\frac{(-1)^{n}}{2n+1} = 1 - \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{5} - \\frac{1}{7} + \\cdots = \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\int\_a^b \\! f(x) dx = F(b) - F(a)f'(a)=\\lim\_{h\\to 0}\\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}\\overline{(z/w)} = \\bar{z}/\\bar{w}\\textstyle r=|z|=\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}\\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 2\\\\ 3 &amp; 4\\\\ \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 1\\\\ 0 &amp; 0\\\\ \\end{bmatrix}= \\begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 1\\\\ 0 &amp; 3\\\\ \\end{bmatrix}</code></pre><p>here’s a alternative syntax (from Mathematica), that preserves semantic structure and is simple and readable:</p><pre><code>Sum\[1/n, {n,1,k}\] ≻ Integrate\[ 1/x ,{1,k+1}\] = Log\[k + 1\]Sum\[ (-1)^n/(2\*n + 1), {n, 0, ∞}\] = 1 - 1/3 + 1/5 + 1/7 + … = π/4Integrate\[ f\[x\] ,{x,a,b}\] = F\[b\] - F\[a\]f'\[a\] = Limit\[ (f\[a+h\]-f\[a\])/h,{h,0}\]Overbar\[z/w\] = Overbar\[z\]/Overbar\[w\]r = Abs\[z\] = Sqrt\[x^2+y^2\]{{1,2},{3,4}} \* {{0,1},{0,0}} = {{0,1},{0,3}}</code></pre><h3 id="The-Structure-in-Math-Expressions"><a href="#The-Structure-in-Math-Expressions" class="headerlink" title="The Structure in Math Expressions"></a>The Structure in Math Expressions</h3><p>Math notation does not always have well-defined structure or meaning. However, it is important to consider the preservation of semantic structure in building a math notation representation language. For example, if we have</p><pre><code>x^2+Sqrt\[x\]</code></pre><p>the system should know that it is a operation applied to two things, each of which is some particular operation on symbols x. Similarly for the traditional notation of matrix, subscripts, sets, absolutes/norms, summation, derivative, integral, … etc.</p><p>Most math expressions form a tree structure, known as abstract syntax tree in computer science. For example:</p><pre><code>+ ^  x  2 sqrt  x</code></pre><p>For any new math notation that does not have a clear structure (say some bunch of arrows towards symbols in some homological algebra), we can for example have a tag that markup the part of expression to indicate that it has no meaning and is for displaying 2D-typeset purposes only.</p><p>In TeX, every math expression is just a sequence of structurally meaningless but micro-position-aware symbols.</p><h2 id="Problems-of-TeX"><a href="#Problems-of-TeX" class="headerlink" title="Problems of TeX"></a>Problems of TeX</h2><p>TeX is detrimental because it harbors ignorance of the structural content embodied in most math notations in most math fields. What TeX does is typesetting, as opposed to math expression encoding. In other words, what TeX does is pretty-printing.</p><p>The language is designed in a way that any structural info in a math expression are botched. As such, TeX, even though it is a full-fledged computer language capable of great programing, but it understands zilch of math expressions, it encodes zilch math expressions. Now that is a egregious error of a computer language purporting to express mathematics. And more so because it is a product of a mathematician who should’ve known better.</p><p>LaTeX mended TeX by turning a pretty printing system into a structured documentation system. However, since TeX at its core is a pretty picture system, no amount fix can correct that other than complete discard. LaTeX fixed nothing about TeX’s botching of the structural info in math notations.</p><p>As a testament of TeX’s shortcomings, TeX botches structural info in math expressions so bad that no program whatsoever short of Human-Level Artificial Intelligence will be be able to convert from TeX into another system of math notation.</p><h2 id="TeX’s-Damage-to-Society"><a href="#TeX’s-Damage-to-Society" class="headerlink" title="TeX’s Damage to Society"></a>TeX’s Damage to Society</h2><p>TeX has done significant damage to the math community, by getting people to focus on pretty printing, which is what typesetting is mainly about. And the key to see this is that TeX has absolutely no concept of the semantic content or structure of math expressions.</p><p>• TeX is a system for typesetting. Typesetting is primarily concerned with esthetics. As a art form, typesetting is insignificant. Typesetting, taken by itself other than reading facilitation, is in general of little serious utility.</p><p>• TeX as a knowledge representation system used by scientists, seduced vast number of scientists into the rather wasteful activity of appearance doodling.</p><p>• TeX, because it is a pure typesetting system and is not aware of any structural info embedded in math notations, it destroys this information whenever math is written in TeX. Even notational systems using plain text such as in Mathematica since 1990, or other computer algebra language, maintains structural info. (by necessity, because they have to actually work in some sense as a math formalism system)</p><p>• Because TeX is free, it halts progress of competing systems and ideas. If TeX had not been invented and given out free, systems that preserve structure (For example, MathML, Mathematica) for the purposes of displaying 2-dimensional math notations, would have been invented earlier or wide spread.</p><p>Free software acts as a virus. Free systems have the potency to wipe out any other protocol or design, including any superior ones (unless they are also free). A example is the various Unix systems and protocols has done huge irreversible damage to society.</p><p>• As a computer language, the design of TeX’s syntax and semantics is arguably bad. The syntax is rather inconsistent, complex, imperative style (as opposed to declarative syntax), and in general the language is difficult to use to control the typesetting or documentation structure. It spread bad ideas or experiences to non-programers, such as mathematicians.</p><p>Any computer language, however bad is its quality, will attract users once exposed to it, and may become addictive, and its users will feel empowered. It’s like jigsaw puzzle in comparison to Rubic Cube. In the context of puzzles, the Jigsaw is a complete waste of time as a game with respect to mathematical values, it however ferment people into fans. A example of this is in computing, is unix shell, and Perl.</p><p>The above ideas is not new, however, it is hardly ever heard. All one hear every day everywhere are chants of the greatness TeX by ignorant computing geeks and mathematicians. The former know coding, the latter knows abstract specialization, both of which in general are ignorant of the history, psychology, and linguistic theories of knowledge presentation and symbolic system. This must be stopped.</p><h2 id="Downfall-of-TeX"><a href="#Downfall-of-TeX" class="headerlink" title="Downfall of TeX"></a>Downfall of TeX</h2><p>I do think TeX’s popularity is waning because of its inappropriateness. They being:</p><ul><li>Not based on Graphical User Interface.</li><li>Not interactive. (its usage requires “compile” cycles)</li><li>Inconsistent syntax.</li><li>Bad language semantics. (it is difficult to use TeX as a embedded language in typeset programing or document structure programing. (compare: Microsoft Word with Visual Basic, Emacs with elisp))</li><li>A system based on appearance, not on math expression structure.</li></ul><p>As of today, structural and semantic info are receiving greater and greater awareness as opposed to formatting or displaying aspects. Witness today’s thoughts of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web">Semantic Web</a>, and a slew of technologies oriented with maintaining structure such as SGML/HTML/XML/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MathML">MathML</a>, DOM, RSS, Mathematica. Even CSS, is structural based that removed formatting issues from HTML, and is today moving to XLS for XML.</p><p>In part, TeX isn’t to blame for its own fall, because it is set out to do typesetting and it does that well. The thing is, the entire typesetting business itself is largely a waste of humanity’s time. As communication tech progresses, typesetting as it is understood (i.e. concerns about em/en-space, ligatures, typefaces) is going to be extinct. [see <a href="http://wordyenglish.com/musing/typography.html">The Moronicities of Typography</a>]</p><h3 id="TeX-and-Microsoft-Equation-Editor-Considered-Equal"><a href="#TeX-and-Microsoft-Equation-Editor-Considered-Equal" class="headerlink" title="TeX and Microsoft Equation Editor Considered Equal"></a>TeX and Microsoft Equation Editor Considered Equal</h3><p>TeX, being a pretty-printing system, can be considered in the same class as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_Editor">Microsoft Word Equation Editor</a>. The difference lies only in their mode of operation. Specifically, TeX is by compile and batch operation like a typical computer language, and the Equation Editor is by using a mouse to click menus and buttons with graphical user interface. The heart of both as far as math notation is concerned, is doodling of a em space or en dash. All math notation’s semantic structure are lost.</p><h3 id="LaTeX-vs-Microsoft-Word-for-Structured-Document"><a href="#LaTeX-vs-Microsoft-Word-for-Structured-Document" class="headerlink" title="LaTeX vs Microsoft Word for Structured Document"></a>LaTeX vs Microsoft Word for Structured Document</h3><p>Consider LaTeX as a structured documentation system. Microsoft Word’s Outline feature does better, plus it has background spell checking, tabs setting, embedded version control, voice annotations, and so on. (provided the person know how to properly use MS Word)</p><h3 id="TeX’s-Place-in-the-World-of-Typesetting"><a href="#TeX’s-Place-in-the-World-of-Typesetting" class="headerlink" title="TeX’s Place in the World of Typesetting"></a>TeX’s Place in the World of Typesetting</h3><p>In order to evaluate TeX asides from its massive brainwashing of the Math community, the question we have to ask is to what degree TeX has made a impact in strictly the typesetting and publishing community. I agree TeX as a typesetting system has made a major impact in this community, however, as a technology, it is far from taking a leading role. Consider <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuarkXpress">QuarkXpress</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FrameMaker">FrameMaker</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF">PDF</a>, all are in similar market and are not free. (PDF document creating software made by Adobe is not free)</p><p>Outside of niche math academic journals, TeX is not used by publishers.</p><h2 id="Frequently-Asked-Questions"><a href="#Frequently-Asked-Questions" class="headerlink" title="Frequently Asked Questions"></a>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><h3 id="Know-More-About-This"><a href="#Know-More-About-This" class="headerlink" title="Know More About This"></a>Know More About This</h3><blockquote><p>So you know more about this than all of us professional mathematicians who have been working with it all our lives?</p></blockquote><p>Successful and professional writers will in general not know much about linguistics or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/writing_system">writing systems</a>. Similarly, musicians typically are ignorant of the history, design, of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_notation">musical notation systems</a> .</p><p>Likewise, professional mathematicians, although they have used math notation all their lives, few have studied or thought about the history of math notation, writing systems, symbolic logic systems, syntax of computer algebra systems or theorem proving systems, linguistics of computer languages, cognizance sciences, psychology of perception, all are related to math notation system.</p><h3 id="TEX-TEX-TEX"><a href="#TEX-TEX-TEX" class="headerlink" title="TEX, TEX, TEX"></a>TEX, TEX, TEX</h3><blockquote><p>In the opinion of just about everyone who knows about such things, TeX is the best markup language where precise and beautiful typography is essential AND for typesetting mathematical formulas and equations. The fact is that ALL professional mathematicians learn TeX as graduate students and write their thesis in TeX and from then on are so hooked on it that they not only write their mathematics in TeX but also usually their letters and other documents. Something written in MS Word just looks ugly by comparison, particularly if it contains formulas using the brain-dead MS equation editor. BTW, just about all physicists use TeX for the same reason.</p></blockquote><p>I’m very well acquainted with the history TeX and its position in society, how scientists receives it, and how ubiquitous and its position as a standard. I’ve read extensively about TeX a decade ago (~1993 to 1998). I’m very well aware how it compares to something like MS Word or other related WYSIWYG equation editors.</p><p>On the whole, my thesis is that TeX, although a extremely successful and well done tool that has satisfied a niche, but it may in fact be a disservice in humanity in that it massively mislead people in the wrong direction. If TeX did not exist, then typesetting will remain in the realm of professional typesetting and printing community, while mathematicians and scientists, will not have wearied their energy into typesetting, but instead put their focus and energy in coming up with a syntax that makes mathematics readable as well as meaningful, based on immense modern knowledge of symbolic logic, computer algebra, and linguistics of computer languages.</p><p>Consider typesetting for a moment. What is it? It is no more than pretty-printing. It has some element that facilitates reading, but only a bit. The bulk of it is meticulousness about appearances. Typical typesetting concerns are things like en-dash, em-dash, ligatures, small-caps, typeface design, serif, sans-serif, micro positions, kerning … etc. Typesetting is a cultural development. Even if we suppose that the esthetics in Western typesetting is universal, its esthetics values in the context of artistic endeavors is dismal. (For example, contrast it with calligraphy, painting, sculpture etc.)</p><p>By introducing TeX the way it is designed, it encroaches the symbolic language of mathematics with pretty-printing, and devalued the system of symbolic communication used by mathematicians, and subtly derailed what mathematicians do best.</p><p>If TeX as it is designed has not been invented, then today we might already have a alternative system such as the proprietary Mathematica, or MathML (very much influenced by Wolfram Research Inc.), which has taken consideration that the symbolic language of mathematics is more than just pretty glyphs arranged in a special way, in that it has a not-well-understood but undeniable structure and relation to mathematics, to such a degree it can influence where mathematics is going, and a design with these thoughts in mind helps us actually advance computational mathematics.</p><h2 id="Alternatives"><a href="#Alternatives" class="headerlink" title="Alternatives"></a>Alternatives</h2><p>In recent years, some software have taken steps to address TeX’s shortcomings.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="最后一根同主题阅读稻草"><a href="#最后一根同主题阅读稻草" class="headerlink" title="最后一根同主题阅读稻草"></a>最后一根同主题阅读稻草</h1><p>无法调用是因为你连一本书的框架和他说什么都没有搞明白，连一般的学科体系和最基本的具体论述都没有建立起来，即没有comprehensible input and notes进入大脑，那自然无法学习。想要跑起来，哪怕再慢，也需要一本书的框架体系。你一战考研包括二战前期就是这个问题，看不懂，不理解，不知道整体在说什么，具体在说什么，怎么论述的，有什么表达意图，都不明确，读不懂自然就没下一步的思考、整理、学习、实践了。</p><p>那么当你花了几个月时间去攻克理解问题，让大脑熟悉了愉悦理解的感觉后呢？理解问题基本解决了，按理来说就可以输出了吧。非也。理解问题基本解决后还有更深层次的问题要探讨，譬如你是不是真的理解，在理解过程中你有没有口头、笔头、脑头费曼？你有没有阶段性暂停pause and ponder？你有没有整体性回顾更新幕布大纲？这些都是保证你理解质量的措施。待理解的质量保证了，我们就要探讨信息留存率的问题了，是通过被动的DMN和REM习得，还是主动的MEM习得？MEM是记大纲还是记具体论述思想？保证了理解的质量和留存问题，才到了调用知识去解决问题的阶段。</p><p>而到了调用阶段，又会出现效率高低不一的情况，导致效率不一的原因是什么？我想是读一本书还是读几本书？拿经济学举例子。你仅仅希望用过真题和书本本身去对应调用非常缓慢的，因为很简单，这本书并不是写给你考外经贸用的，所以用课本，尤其是老外的课本直接对应考题是效率很低的一种做法，当然效率低不意味着没效率，或者说如果你只有老外的教材，更极端点说你就是个老外但想考中国研究生，那么你怎么也得有几本书来比较，框架是比较出来的，一家之言终归浅，效果还不一定好。吃透一本书可以花一辈子的时间，但同时看明白（知道作者说什么、怎么说）几本书，并不需要花多久时间，因为意图好懂，但细节难纠。所以主题阅读一定是个高效率的阅读方式，你现在没几天了，想要单单研究透一本书怕是不可能了。但是用主题阅读弄明白考试意图，或许可行。我们再回到具体操作路径上来，如果不能仅用外国人的教材，那么还应该用什么？我想是一些教辅资料，比如圣才的，郑炳的，还有其他人的教材，以及一些考试题目。你的研究目的有两个，一是知道原本的经济体系如何，不用细究。二是考试体系如何，部分细究。通过教材和教辅知道经济体系如何，通过教辅和考题知道考试体系如何，单用教辅是一件无比低效和无用的事情，但是一旦结合其教材和考题，那么就可以最大化它的作用，希望你好好好利用和正视，毕竟很难全面肯定或否定一个人，也很难全面肯定或否定一本书。</p><p>数学同理，比较对照着看外国教材，中国教材，教辅资料，考试题目等。基本形成学科体系，主要形成考试体系。这里多一句嘴，因为你此前花了很多时间在闭关修炼的课堂上，毋庸置疑，张宇的讲课能力足够优秀，让你对考研数学的考试体系如何有了一番新的认知，但这依旧没有办法帮你在做真题的过程中迅速调用这些知识，原因在于这是他的知识体系，不是你的，哪怕他讲得再好，你听了再多遍，也终究不是你的。为了解决这个问题，你应该尝试把闭关修炼和他的36讲，中国教材，外国教材对照着看，先不管具体论述如何，而是独观大略，先知道整体在考什么，经济学也是如此，这样你获取有效信息的效率会提高，你自己的框架也会逐步形成，因为一个人的框架是比较多种框架（或者起码不同角度）提炼而成的，仅看一个人做出来的框架还是别人的，哪有你什么事？最少也两个吧？同主题阅读虽然数量多，但是阅读效率也高，所以并不会花你太多时间。而唯有你在同主题形成框架后，再去纠结细节，才会心安理得和泰然自若，也才能更好的分配每个专题细究的时间，不然每个专题你都可以花一辈子去研究它。在你通过比较形成自己的框架后（主要是脑中形成，能用幕布外化最好，如果主观不行或客观做不到也成，但框架感一定得有），加之一定的专题训练，我相信你的调用速度会大大提升。此时你应该就形成了高框架输入（主题阅读）、高细节输入（专项训练）、高信息留存（DMN、REM、MEM）、高知识调用（频繁输出、刻意练习）。</p><p>同主题阅读，怕是能救你的最后一根稻草，能否成功试一试再说。</p><p>『注』只能是同主题阅读，不能是同主题听力，一是看的材料比听的视频多太多。二是看的效率比听的效率快太多，看可以随时跳，哪怕是线性阅读也比线性听力快一倍。三是看的效果更好，人的视觉记忆比听觉记忆强不少。<br>2019-12-08凌晨2点</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="高情商即高自我情绪管理能力"><a href="#高情商即高自我情绪管理能力" class="headerlink" title="高情商即高自我情绪管理能力"></a>高情商即高自我情绪管理能力</h1><p>高情商是高自我情绪管理能力，这句话我是从富捷的文章《争与不争》中看到。他论述道，高情商、高智商、高逆商等各类所谓的商都统一于智慧，智慧乃各商之源、之本，各商同进退共患难，不存在一商特高而众商皆低的情况，这就和我们的英语能力一样，听说读写4项能力相辅相成，同进退共患难。我是认同的。<br>富捷还说到，高情商不是高超的处理人际关系能力，它仅仅指的就是自我管理情绪的能力，能管理好自己的情绪就算有高的情商。如果硬要把高情商和处理人际关系搭上边，那么就可以说，如果你既有管理好自己情绪的能力，同时还能妥善处理好周遭他人的情绪，那么你的情商相当高，比一众之高还要高。但这一切都是建立在你有自我管理情绪的能力基础之上的，自我管理是底下的1，他人管理是上面的n。仅会搞关系绝不能称之为高情商。</p><p>说回到我自己，李某人你的情商如何？可以说，不咋滴。何以见得？从昨晚应对考研报考点的紧急情况可见。广财作为历年的考研报考点，此前一直都是网上申请，现场缴费、确认，而今年或许想省事，与其他“先进”的报考点一样，采取网上缴费、网上确认的方式。着实，这让报考点和考生都便利了，起码去现场确认的路费和时间省下了。然而，对于我这类应届毕业后没有找工作，直接选择全职在家考研的学生来说，并不是个好事，因为会受限于工作证明和社保证明等材料问题。以往，像我这类全职考研的人数并不算少，也皆是没有找工作的，自然谈不上什么工作证明和社保证明。但因以往广财报考点现场确认采用的是现场的方式，那么对于这些往届生来说所必要的证明材料，就可以通过人工审核的“疏漏”而蒙混过关，然而，如果一旦要进行网上确认，那么工作证明这一项必须上传的证明资料，就给蒙混过关增添了难度。具体要怎么操作，现在仍是不得而知，知道的一点是，这突如其来的黑天鹅事件，会比预期额外花费我不少时间，昨晚就因自我情绪管理能力不佳，在担心、恐慌以及查阅相关信息来试图安慰自己上花费了将近2个小时，尽管客观上来说，我做的这些努力对于解决实际问题而言一点帮助也没有，毕竟生杀大权皆取决于报考点，想问题有解决的希望，最有效的就是打广财考试招生办的服务电话。这就是我昨晚情商低的表现。</p><p>希望，也只能是希望颂洋今日去问的时候，有个不错的解决方案，尽管目前我的考试准备仍不算充足和达预期，但我仍希望能善终这场考试，与去年的态度一样。另外就是，你的情绪管理能力还有待提高，借以这次黑天鹅事件，愿你能从中提取中出有效信息，让大脑学习，从而在下一次应对黑天鹅事件时，能处理地相对更成熟和游刃有余，人生路子还长，问题总会有解决的方法。自勉。<br>2019.10.30早8点</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="解决个人思绪紊乱的窘况"><a href="#解决个人思绪紊乱的窘况" class="headerlink" title="解决个人思绪紊乱的窘况"></a>解决个人思绪紊乱的窘况</h1><p>个人思绪因大脑思考的无序性和跳跃性，所以时常陷入窘况是必然无法避免的。而在今天考完英语走回来的过程中，总结了几个可以有效梳理自己思路的方式，以时常整理自己混乱已久的大脑，相信在大多数情况下都适用。</p><p>第一，脑想。脑想其实本质上来说也不是一种方式，因为脑想是一直在进行的，无论你采取的是什么行为，大脑思考都一直伴随着你，只是你是主动思考，还是被动思考（后台思考）。而我这里指的思考是主动思考，往往是在注意力高度集中的情况下，大脑那种聚精会神地思考状态，而往往这种状态是自发形成的，非常具有随机性，可遇而不可求，故这里为了论述的完整性将其列出来，虽是主动思考，但确实被动出现后的主动思考。</p><p>第二，口述。口述应该是二战以来，在家学习的最大收获之一。因为此前一直待在图书馆，用口述来整理思想这一方式无形之中就被抹杀了，而只有在每日下午到运动场散步的时候才会偶尔用用，所以自己的感受并不明显，而在家呆的这半年过程中，通过大量的口述获得大脑清晰的感觉是无言可喻的。由此将其作为重要的个人梳理思绪方式，当然并不总是有效，但成功几率要比脑想高。这仅仅指的是单向口述，而一对一口述（深度交流）和一对多口述（大众演讲）不仅能达到整理自己思绪的方式，还能有其他功效，比如弥补自己的思维盲区，训练自己的口语表达等等。这些都是作为输出端的应用，口述也能作为输入端去读，因为放下了速度，所以理解力也提高了，因本篇文章在讲述梳理思绪的重要性，故不细谈。</p><p>第三，手打。这里的手打值得是用手机打字和用电脑打字。二者的区别在于，对于没有近视的人来说，区别仅有长时间手机打字2个手指会累，而长时间电脑打字因动用的是10根手指，所以累的没那么快。换言之，电脑打字速度更快，快多少取决于使用这两个机器的熟练程度。而对于像我这样的戴不戴眼镜思维会有较大差异的人来说，虽然戴眼镜用电脑打的速度快，不累，但是为了保证输出文字的质量，我会倾向于用手机进行纯文字的输出，这里提到纯文字是因为电脑打字和手机打字相比不仅有速度上的优势，在输出的符号形式也有众多不同，其形式会更为丰富，所以如果你需要打一些图表或者数学符号，那就只能采用电脑手打的方式了。</p><p>第四，手写。此前我是并不接受手写的，因为不仅字写的丑，而且写的还慢，一秒钟一个字都很难做到。而在我上一次为了模考政治大题而去尝试大量手写的过程中，我发现其对我大脑思路的整理效果要远远超过手打的方式。诚如上面所说，要实现一秒钟一个字很难，速度很慢，和电脑打字（使用双拼的话）轻松达到一秒钟两个字相比，确实低效。但慢虽是它最大的劣势，也是其最大的优势，正因为慢，所以想的清楚，也正因为慢，所以想的明白，逻辑通顺。那么有些人就会说，那我慢慢说不行吗？可以是可以，但口述无形呀。所以不深刻。那又有人说我可以用讯飞语记语音转文字呀，可以也是可以，但除非你已然接受了剑飞那样的魔鬼训练或者自己进行了大量的实践，否则你能对自己的语音输出质量作担保吗？我想未必吧，而如果你为了刻意追求这种口述转文字表达的准确性而放慢自己的说话速度，在流畅梳理方面会非常难受，并且还可能需要事后大量修正，所以还不如不用。故手写的地位无法被慢慢口述取代。</p><p>综上，脑想、口述、手打、手写是你大脑思绪混乱时可以采取的主动行动，每一种行动都有失效的情形，也有突然间非他不可的情况，所以请结合你自己的具体情况，相机抉择。我相信，在这几种方式的联合帮助下，你个人思绪紊乱的窘况能够得到非常好的缓解。<br>2019-12-21</p>]]></content>

      <title>框架导图必要吗？</title>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="框架导图必要吗？"><a href="#框架导图必要吗？" class="headerlink" title="框架导图必要吗？"></a>框架导图必要吗？</h1><p>框架对于写作是否必要，虽然和泉是顺应大脑思路往下走，不需要任何的框架，但对于我来说，还暂时得不出确切结论。不过对于阅读而言，或者更广泛一些，对于输入而言，以框架的形式做一个统筹规划工作，是十分利于日后回顾的。<br>用框架来留住输入信息的优缺点这里谈一下。</p><p>优点是，第一这给你去all in当前这个材料提供了动力。因为你不仅仅是为了当下读懂、听懂和玩爽的那一份感觉，在信息输入完毕后，你还需要交付一份导图框架作为收尾，这个导图的是否严谨、符合逻辑等质量问题我们暂且不谈，毕竟这不是做给别人看的，而是为你自己服务的，具体怎么为你服务？</p><p>这就来到接下来的第二个优点，方便你事后回忆和调用。你日后大量或听到大量良莠不齐的信息材料这是毋庸置疑的事情，那么如果你不做一些笔记的话，代你需要调用它们的时候，要再重新认真的看一遍吗？认真看可是要花精力的，哪怕这是你喜欢做的事情，也是耗费精力的，而每天的精力是有限的，你不可能每天都对那几份材料反复投入大量时间吧，况且你接触的优质信息还不一定多，要是对一些垃圾但必须知道的信息反复看，那真的就是浪费生命。所以，有这么一个导图轻轻带一下你的回忆，你的记忆很快就会被提取出来，也就不需要再正儿八经地看一遍了。</p><p>第三，是有成就感。虽然做框架导图不是什么成就，做几千几百张也说明不了什么，但是你确实在做事呀，确实有一张张的东西交付出来，做和不做还是有区别的。以及结果其实并不重要，重要的是画图的这个过程，你得对目标信息有一定的理解后才能画出图来，而对于不理解的信息，在画图的过程中还能帮助理解。还有其他的优点这里就不继续谈了。</p><p>接下来谈谈缺点。最主要就是思维惯性，导图很容易强加联系，给自己无拘无束的思维带来束缚，遇到某些问题后定式思维，不会绕弯子。要明白，思维的本质是跳跃、离散、无固定联系的。这也是和泉反对导图的最大原因。</p><p>进一步就不分析了，过几天就要考研了，感觉导图在应试的过程中能起到不少作用，那就用起来，看一看能造成什么程度。<br>2019-12-11</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="暂时无题"><a href="#暂时无题" class="headerlink" title="暂时无题"></a>暂时无题</h1><p>在经过那么久的一个独自生活学习的时间，发现自己虽然没有在生活上有多大长进，但是在营造学习环境上，进步还是相当大的，就目前207的这个房间，可以说是我这辈子学习环境最好的一个空间，实在是太棒了，如果可以不上大学，可以不去工作，我真的希望能够一直赖在这个空间里进行自我修养的提升，实在是一个无与伦比的空间。该有的电子设施基本都有，想要的物质材料也不短缺，没有过多的杂物堆放，尽管可能在别人眼里看来有些混乱不堪，但在我眼里却显得无比的有序和有理。希望在接下来的60天里，你能充分利用好这个空间所带给你的无敌的工作和学习环境，最高效地去汲取考研的有效信息，以期在考试当天能够得心应手。</p><p>在今日吃完午饭后，回到房间看见自己几日前从书柜里拿出来的《傅雷家书》，在那时便想读上一读，感受一下在半个世纪以前一个老父亲是怎么给自己孩子写信的感情，父子家信又和此前在《且以优雅过一生》的杨绛传记中钱锺书写给杨绛的感情不同，更多是一种包含万物、深厚悠长的情绪。</p><p>输出确实是重要的，这种自己的写作输出，自己的思想表达是重要的，不去训练，始终不会好起来，写作表达能力始终没有长进。以往，你说写作速度影响了你自我表达的效率，那么你从手写转化为手机写；你说戴眼镜造成你思考不顺畅，那么你用手机写不需要戴眼镜；你说全拼打字太慢了，那么你用双拼起码节约了不少时间。用手机来进行你的文字表达，就目前的情况来说，应该是再好不过的最优解了，可以跟上你所谓的“快速”的思维。</p><p>说实话，英文打字确实是有些怪异，这里怪异的原因主要局限于我个人的英文水平和普适的写作表达能力不行。</p><p>我在试着用语言、用写作来尝试理清我自己混乱的逻辑，来尝试陷入一个写作的状态，就好像今天自己陷入看文字的状态一般，陷入和泉的文字，陷入傅雷的文字。写作和打游戏和弹奏钢琴和跑步和等等一切实践活动一样，它们都是有其专有的flow状态，既然我可以在打王者荣耀的时候陷入这个巴掌大的手机屏幕里，那为什么我不能在将自己的文字外化的时候陷进去？讲道理，这应该是行得通的，而且也能预想到的是，陷进去也会蛮有趣的。是一种完全自发、极其高效、无需他人管控和监督的状态，异常的令人兴奋和激动。</p><p>接下来，我们来谈一谈日常通过手机文字表达自己想法的可能性，在这个过程中，有什么难点？最大的难点莫过于，没有思想输出，以及就算有思想输出的欲望，那么这个思想输出是否一定要借以文字这一媒介和形式来表达？文字这一表达形式的最大优势究竟在哪？相比电脑当然是便携和无需带眼镜，手机你可以随时随地取出来，方便快捷，在双拼输入的帮助下，你的打字速度也有了质的提高。同时基于它的电子化，相较于手写纸质而言，速度快自然就不必说了，可修改和再排版更是其一大特色。另外，将手机拿在手上输出，就距离感而言，也比用电脑和手写感觉要亲切的多，起码就距离看来是如此。再来，我们把时间范围拉长一点，就现实生活或者说以后的现实生活应用中，有什么好处？手机打字快可以让自己在短通讯领域聊天里脱颖而出，别人都是几个字几个字地往外挤牙膏，而你没几分钟就洋洋洒洒几百字出来，如果双方的沟通效率低下这一点上，起码可以排除自己的问题，毕竟你说了那么多话，哪怕一大部分是废话，就有效信息概率×全部字数＝有效信息字数而言，你也表达了比别人多的多的信息，所以如果出现沟通不畅的情况，那么问题或不在你。在这个短通讯、短信息、多资讯、浮躁气盛的时代，“长篇累牍”的文字表达能力不失为一个珍贵的能力。</p><p>为什么要读书？其实本质上是在问为什么要阅读文字。书籍不过是数篇过审的、相对有质量的、表达较清晰的文章集合，与其说读书，倒不如说是读文章，读到好文章与读到好书时的感觉是一样一样的。文字是相当浓缩、高效的信息传达载体，尽管许多国内的教材滥用文字，导致给人造成一种一看到文字就头疼的感觉，比如先前的我一看到文字就烦，压根没有想过将阅读文字作为排解苦闷的方式，更甭提像现在这样通过写作的方式来梳理自己的想法了。能够在这几天陷入阅读文字从而高效获取信息的感觉真好，美中不足的是，所获取的内容是对自己长远发展而言大有裨益的内容，而并非能解目前自己燃眉之急的考研内容。不过，获取到有效信息进而转换为知识和思想的感觉是相通的，保持住大脑对这种有效信息输入的敏感度，我相信你能够马上陷入高效获取考研学科有效信息的状态。</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>#Reprint </p><h3 id="用强力研读书"><a href="#用强力研读书" class="headerlink" title="用强力研读书"></a>用强力研读书</h3><blockquote><p>本文选自万维钢的《万万没想到——用理工科思维理解世界》。</p><img src="https://lewis-img.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/img/万万没想到——用理工科思维理解世界.png" alt="万万没想到——用理工科思维理解世界" style="zoom:50%;"></blockquote><p>武侠小说常常把武林高手描写成能够以一当十甚至以一当百的人物，但事实是一个人再怎么练武也不能变成坦克。在真实世界中，即使你武功再高，我摆个十人枪阵——不用机关枪，就是古代的那种三四米长的冷兵器长枪——也能轻易地把你杀死。但是一个人的见识却可以达到以一当百或者更高的境界。一个真正有学问的人，他的「内力」之高，你上再多俗人也没用。</p><p>跑步和练武对人身体素质的提高都非常有限，读书却可以极大幅度地提升人的思想内力。这种内力是对世界的理解和见识。</p><p>读书的目的是获得见识以及学习高水平的思维方法。这个世界经常会发生一些有意思的事情，它们令很多人兴奋，迷惑，或愤怒，而大多数人只会在新闻网页的评论中发泄自己的情绪。如果你读过这方面的书，也许就会指出：第一，这件事其实没什么，我知道比这个更好／更坏／更怪的事；第二，那个所谓专家说的意见属于X流派，而学术界对这派有很大的争议，其实他们已经过时了，比如获得××××年诺贝尔经济学奖的Y理论，就是个更好的理论；第三，我估计此事将会向××××××方向发展。著名经济学作者蒂姆·哈福德出过一本《亲爱的卧底经济学家》，这是他在《金融时报》答读者问的短篇合集，其中每一篇文章都是这样的套路。有学问跟没学问是很不一样的。</p><p>即使不想当专栏作家，做一个有学问的人总是有用的。当没学问的人大惊小怪的时候，有学问的人可以见怪不怪；当没学问的人熟视无睹的时候，有学问的人却可以见微知著。</p><p>从读书的角度看，世界上有两种人。</p><p>一种人读书是为了掌握技能，通过各类考试，或者纯粹是为了娱乐。另一种人读书却是为了提升自己的内力。这两种人最初的“智力”水平未必有多大差别，但是假以时日，他们的“智慧”水平将会有天壤之别。只有后一种人，才配被称为<strong>「读书人」</strong>。</p><p>这里我想谈谈「读书人」应该怎么读书。</p><p>我国最畅销的图书类型是各种教学参考书和考试辅导书，它们不算书。金庸、琼瑶的小说当然得算书，但看这种书不值得讲究什么技术。我们专门研究怎么读那些看完之后能够加深自己对某一领域的理解，能够获得一种智慧上升的感觉（哪怕是错觉）的非小说类的书。</p><p>这种书有三个基本事实。</p><p><strong>第一，大多数人不看这种书；他们不是读书人。</strong></p><p><strong>第二，如果真看了的，其中大多数人没有看完。</strong>在亚马逊买Kindle版的电子书后，你可以看到别的读者在书上画的最流行的重点。Kindle允许你在读书的时候在认为是重点的语句上画线，而亚马逊会把画线比较多的语句在书中标记出来。我看了很多非小说类的书，其中的规律是绝大多数流行重点出现在前两章。而书的四分之一以后，就基本上看不到重点标记了。难道这些书的后面都没有重点值得画了吗？答案显然是大多数人对大多数书都只看了四分之一就不看了<a href="%E5%A6%82%E6%9E%9C%E4%BD%A0%E7%9C%8B%E5%88%B0%E8%BF%99%E5%8F%A5%E8%AF%9D%EF%BC%8C%E8%AF%B4%E6%98%8E%E4%BD%A0%E5%9D%9A%E6%8C%81%E9%98%85%E8%AF%BB%E6%9C%AC%E4%B9%A6%E5%88%B0%E4%BA%86%E4%B8%80%E5%AE%9A%E7%9A%84%E9%95%BF%E5%BA%A6%EF%BC%8C%E4%B9%9F%E8%AE%B8%E4%BD%A0%E5%B7%B2%E7%BB%8F%E5%87%BB%E8%B4%A5%E4%BA%86%E4%B8%80%E5%8D%8A%E4%BB%A5%E4%B8%8A%E7%9A%84%E8%AF%BB%E8%80%85">^如果你看到这句话，说明你坚持阅读本书到了一定的长度，也许你已经击败了一半以上的读者。</a>。最近华尔街日报上一篇文章[^The-Summers-Most-Unread-Book]使用统计kindle上重点句子的方法发现，大多数读者读《时间简史》只读到了6.6%，读《思考，快与慢》只读到了6.8%，而读被视为近年来最重要经济学著作的《二十一世纪资本论》，则只读到2.4%，尽管这本是当前亚马逊上最畅销的书。爱买书的人不一定真读书，很多人只不过是爱藏书而已。</p><p><strong>第三，即使看完了的，其中大多数人没有看懂。</strong>我就举蒂姆·哈福德的成名作《卧底经济学》（Undercover Economist）这本书做个例子。在我写此文的最初版本时候[^当时是2009年，现在修改此文的时候，该页面上又有了几篇新的书评，这些书评写的仍然不靠谱。]，此书在豆瓣有三个页面，其中只有中文版页面有不算灌水的读者书评。在豆瓣上的6篇热门评论中，最热的一篇，“子不曰”的《撕开面皮给你看》，谈到了书中说的星巴克咖啡和超市搞乱价格现象；第二篇的题目就是此书的标题，内容不是读书心得，而更像是给书做的广告；第三篇《真实世界经济学》，提到星巴克，然后不知为何开始谈另一本讲经济学的书和自己读经济学读物的过程；第四篇，谈到星巴克、房价、超市定价和大学生的火车票。读这些书评，似乎《卧底经济学》是一本讲述生活中的经济小故事的漫谈。</p><p>但这本书并不是纯粹漫无边际的瞎侃。它的观点相当鲜明，主题很突出。此书反复强调一个概念，「稀缺」。第一章写星巴克卖咖啡的例子，为的是指出没有稀缺就不可能赚钱。第二章写有了稀缺你也未必能赚到很多钱：哪怕附近只有你一家超市，顾客也未必会在你这里花很多钱买东西。你必须使用一系列的手段，甚至诡计，来让人掏钱。最典型的办法是对顾客实行区别定价。第三章到第五章写经济学家为什么喜欢市场，因为市场调节可以自动把稀缺的东西变得不那么稀缺！然后谈到市场为什么有时候会失灵。政府的有些政策，表面上为了公平，但客观上是促进了稀缺，比如说不让优质小学的入学市场化。第六章指出像亚马逊这样的公司并没有真正意义上的稀缺力量。第七章到第十章则是前面这些理论在当前热点问题中的应用。</p><p>如果我们看完这本书只记住两个字，这两个字应该是<strong>「稀缺」</strong>。但是看看排在前四名的豆瓣书评，竟然没有一篇提到“稀缺”这个词！如果你只看这四篇书评，你记住的两个字是“咖啡”。而星巴克怎么卖咖啡，其实是该书前四页说的事情。</p><p>用这种读法就算再读15本讲经济学的书也学不会用经济学家的眼光去看世界，得到的只不过是一大堆饭桌上的小段子而已。等到下次听专家说话，感觉还是似曾相识，自己又说不出来。</p><p>所以，读书这件事没那么简单，它也需要技术。有会读的，有不会读的，不是爱读就行。</p><p>有很多人总结过读书的技术。总结得最好的大概是名著《如何阅读一本书》[^How-to-Read-A-Book]。现在在网上可以找到很多关于这本书中阅读技巧的笔记总结。在我看来，此书最牛的地方并不在于任何特殊的技术，而是一种精神。这种精神认为阅读有三个档次：为了娱乐而读，为了信息而读和为了理解而读。首先，只有为了理解某个我们原来不懂的东西而读书，才值得认真对待。其次，读书应该以我为主，而不是以书为主。此书作者说，世界上值得反复阅读的书不超过一百本（并在书后列举了这一百本书），其他所有的书基本上读完就可以扔了。凡是真能做到以这样的精神去读书的人都是真正的精神贵族，他们与那些藏书的书虫完全不同。《如何阅读一本书》几乎是手把手地教给读者一套细致的读书方法，不厌其烦，以至于很多读者迷失在这些方法的细节之中。然而有讽刺意味的是，我看了很多人们对《如何阅读一本书》这本书做的笔记，这些笔记大都未能把握这种高级的阅读精神。</p><h4 id="强力研读"><a href="#强力研读" class="headerlink" title="强力研读"></a>强力研读</h4><p>本书在《如何阅读一本书》的基础上，提倡一种高强度的读书方法，称之为“强力研读”。与《如何阅读一本书》中按部就班的，烦琐的固定套路不同，我们的「强力研读」更像是一种态度和心法。其实我很想给此文起一个英文标题，叫做 Deep Reading（深度阅读），以与最近心理学家们谈论的训练天才的新成果，「刻意练习」（deliberate practice，deeppractice），相呼应。</p><p>「强力研读」并不是为了读《广义相对论》之类的专业著作，它面向的对象就是《卧底经济学》之类写给非专业读者的非小说类书籍。称为「强力」，是因为它追求阅读的深度和效率，力图能在一本书中挖掘到最大限度的收获。我曾经听过一个笑话，说我们是怎么向别人学习的呢？我们就如同小偷一样到别人家里把除了厨房水槽之外的所有东西都搬走了——然后我们回过头去把厨房水槽也搬走了。我们就要用这样的精神去读一本书！</p><p>强力研读跟「刻意练习」[^你是跳着看本书的吗？关于刻意练习参见前面的《练习一万小时成天才？》。]有三个共同点：</p><p><strong>第一，不好玩。</strong>世界冠军培训基地没有“寓教于乐”这个概念。“强力研读”不是为了娱乐和休息，而是用非常严肃认真的态度，非得把一本书融会贯通以至于「长」在自己的大脑里不可。这种读法相当累。我认为写读书笔记是一个非常正经的工作。</p><p><strong>第二，用时少。</strong>就如同在那种专门培养天才的最好的音乐学校里，孩子们每天真正练琴的时间绝对不超过2个小时一样。没人能长时间坚持那样的强度，而没有强度的训练还不如不练。你可能每天花很多时间阅读，但你很难做到用很多的时间强力研读。要把精力充沛而又不受打扰的时间段留给最好的书。</p><p><strong>第三，不追求快。</strong>很多读书方法教人怎么用最快的速度读完一本书，而那些有必要快速读完的书根本不配让我们读。读书的一个关键技术在于对不同的读物采取不同的阅读速度。娱乐性的小说，纯粹信息性的新闻，读得越快越好。而对于处在我们的“学习区”内的好书，则应该慢慢地仔细读。把一本书快速读完，就好像把一首曲子快速弹完一样，这不是练琴，这是为了完成练琴任务。读书人的一个秘密就是，读得慢，吸收知识和增长内力的效率会更高。据说失读症患者之所以特别容易出人才就是因为他们读得慢[^关于失读症患者的故事，参见本书《匹夫怎样逆袭》一文。]。</p><p>以下是强力研读的具体做法，它的核心技术是读书笔记。</p><h4 id="新书要读两遍"><a href="#新书要读两遍" class="headerlink" title="新书要读两遍"></a>新书要读两遍</h4><p>一本书应该被读两遍，而且只读两遍。好书读一遍你不可能掌握到精要，反过来说如果一遍就够了，那这本书也不值得强力研读。我们说的思想类书籍，不是什么学术著作，所以再好也没必要读三遍。两遍正好。而且最有效率的办法是读完一遍马上再读一遍。</p><p>第一遍是正常通读，只要放松地欣赏作者的精妙思想和有趣故事即可。不要追求读得快，值得时不时停下来思考一下的书才是好书。</p><p>在读第二遍的同时写下读书笔记。这时候就不要每个字都读了，书中作为例子的故事大可跳过，要专注于思想脉络。读一章，记一章笔记，直至读完。然后这本书就可以束之高阁，甚至直接扔了。</p><h4 id="什么是好的读书笔记？"><a href="#什么是好的读书笔记？" class="headerlink" title="什么是好的读书笔记？"></a>什么是好的读书笔记？</h4><p>读书笔记的一个重大作用是为自己日后以最快速度重温这本书提供方便，直接看笔记就可以。还有别的好书等着我们去读呢，所以笔记最好要写到可以取代原书的程度。</p><p>我看过很多平庸的笔记，有些就如同小学生给课文概况中心思想和段落大意一样。网上有很多人用画“思维导图”的方法来做读书笔记，这种方法的意义也不大。流水账式的读书笔记就好像用胸围、臀围、腰围这三个数字来描写一名美女一样无趣。</p><p>强力研读要求读书笔记必须包括四方面的内容：</p><ul><li>①清晰地表现每一章的逻辑脉络；  </li><li>②带走书中所有的亮点；  </li><li>③有大量的自己的看法和心得；  </li><li>④发现这本书和以前读过的其他书或文章的联系。</li></ul><p>许多人的笔记只有摘要概括。能做到第一点，找到逻辑脉络，就已经算是优秀笔记了。我只看到过极少的人偶尔在笔记中插入书中亮点。至于后面这两点，能做到的更是凤毛麟角。但是只有做到全部四点，你才能把一本书的效用发挥到最大。你会发现这个回报是巨大的。</p><p>我习惯完全按照原书的章节给读书笔记划分章节，甚至保留各章的标题。在每一章的开头，用自己的话写下这一章作者到底想说什么，各章穿起来就形成了系统——不过，这种内容提要并不重要。</p><p>重要的是一定要能看出作者的逻辑脉络。大多数人之所以没有真正地理解一本书，就是因为看不到这个脉络。每一章的逻辑结构如果真写出来也许只有几句话，可是这几句话却常常是分布在好几十页之中。善于写书的作者往往会在书中收录大量引人入胜的小故事（包括科研案例、历史典故和名人轶事），只有把这些小故事串起来我们才能明白作者到底在说什么。单独看其中的一个故事，每个人都会对这个故事有不同的解读。然而这个故事在书中的作用却往往会被人忽略，最后只记住了小故事这棵树木，而看不到它们组成的森林。</p><p>现代人喜欢小段子，往往能记住作者讲的笑话而忘了作者的本意。在美国历史上，没有电视、没有网络、更没有微博的“印刷机时代”，史蒂芬·道格拉斯（他曾经跟林肯竞争过美国总统，还竞争过老婆，最后都失败了）曾经跟林肯有过连续7场的著名辩论。道格拉斯口才极好，常出妙语，但是他告诫听众不要为妙语鼓掌。《娱乐至死》这本书是这么说的：</p><blockquote><p>道格拉斯甚至批评他的听众，说他需要的是听众的理解而不是激情，说他的听众应该是沉思默想的读者才好……阅读要求的是理性思考．一个好的读者不会因为偶然发现了什么警句妙语而欣喜若狂或情不自禁地鼓掌——一个忙于分析的读者恐怕无暇顾及这些。</p></blockquote><p>我们小时候学习的那些“中国古代寓言”，就是从古书中提出来的小故事，而我们对这些寓言的解读往往背离古人写书时的本意。我们记住了故事却忘记了文章。所以，读书笔记的第一作用就是抛开故事记住文章。让一本书从厚变薄，从具体的山川景色变成抽象的地图。只有当你跳出字里行间，以居高临下的姿态俯视全书，它的脉络才能变得清晰。看清楚以后，不要抄作者的话，用自己的语言把这个脉络写出来，就好像画地图一样。</p><p>但是如果一个小故事实在是很好，我们也得把它留下。好的读书笔记是不均匀分布的。记笔记，是我听说了一个想法之后很激动，必须把这个想法记下来据为己有的行为。除了逻辑脉络之外，如果发现真正好的小故事——我们称之为“亮点”——那么就把这个故事也给写下来，甚至具体到细节。一方面，以后万一要写文章，从笔记里翻出来就可以用。更重要的是，这些故事将会反复地在我们的大脑中出现，它们用各种出其不意的方式左右我们的思想，直至改变我们对世界的认识。你不得不承认有些段子的生命力就是比其原来的文章更长，以至于最后成为典故。</p><p>我用 Kindle 看其他人对一本书划的重点语句，发现这些语句大都是总结式的，就好像小学生在课文里发现的重点句一样，它们通常是段落的第一句或者最后一句。  真正的高手读书不能用这种线性读法，而应该是「一惊一乍」的。作者的哪句话是令人拍案叫绝的？哪句话是一语惊醒梦中人的？应该把这样的东西突出记下来。我有时候听凤凰卫视的《开卷八分钟》，这是一个向观众介绍书的电视栏目。我发现其他几个主持人往往倾向于在节目中系统地介绍一本书的内容框架，而梁文道则总能在一本书中找到几个单独的亮点，常常拿出一两个意味深长的故事给观众，让人能够体会到原书作者的个性。读书笔记得有这个效果。读书，在某种程度上就是在寻找能够刺激自己思维的那些亮点。我们在分析脉络的时候要忽略故事，分析完脉络再把故事带走[^据说韩寒有个小本本专门记录别人作品中的亮点。但如果只记亮点不记逻辑那也是不对的。]。</p><p>「强力研读」是一种主动的读书方法。要在笔记中写下自己对此书的评论，好像跟作者对话一样。我现在的统一做法是把自己的评论全部放在方括号“【】”中，将来翻阅的时候哪些是书里的，哪些是自己的一目了然。</p><p>藏书人认为书的干净最重要，所以他们不看书；低水平的读书人会在看完的书上画满了重点线；而高水平的读书人会在看完的书上写满了批注。历史上，牛人读书都喜欢在书页的空白处批注。据说人们一般不爱把书借给毛泽东看，因为他看完之后别人没法看了，书上密密麻麻的全是他的批注。</p><p>你不可能对说得好的一段话无动于衷。你可以写下自己对这件事的理解，你还可以写下对作者的质疑或肯定。更高级的批注则是写下自己因为看到这段文字而产生的灵感。一本好书的每一章都能让人迸发出十个以上的灵感。也许它突然就解决了你之前一直关注的问题——尽管这个问题看似与此书无关；也许你会想把作者的理论往前推一步。这些想法未必都有用，但是都非常宝贵，因为如果你不马上记下来，它们很快就会被忘记。也许多年以后翻阅笔记的时候你会觉得自己的心得灵感比原书更有价值。</p><p>当你读过的书多到一定程度，你就会发现书与书之间是存在联系的。尤其是现代人写的书，极少有一本书的思想完全独立于世界，真正新的知识往往都是建立在旧的知识之上。这个问题别的书是怎么说的？有没有更新的证据支持或反对这个结论？要找到它们的共同点和不同点。一个真正善于主动读书的人对这种联系是非常敏感的。我现在使用印象笔记（Evernote）来整理读书笔记，这个工具可以把每一份笔记都生成一个可供别的笔记直接点击和引用的链接。我的笔记中经常出现这样的链接，用于指出书与书之间的联系。</p><p>小时候，我们都曾经有一段时间对新词汇非常敏感。比如你可能从电视上听说一个成语，即使你不能确定这个成语的准确意思，但你还是觉得这个词很好。结果在接下来的几个月甚至几天之中，你又多次遇到这个成语！你可能会奇怪怎么以前没注意到它，难道这个词最近专门爱找你吗？一个读书人对新的知识就能保持这样的敏感。你一旦发现一个有意思的新课题并且读了这方面的书，你就会主动或者被动地多次与这个课题相遇。你刚放下这本书，一上网又看到一篇这方面的文章。过几天你打开手机又发现微博上有人正在讨论它。这时候你应该怎么办？打开印象笔记整理一份这方面的笔记！</p><p>如果你读得足够多，你会获得一种更难得的经历：感受人类知识的进步。你会发现一个问题在这本书里是这个说法，而过了几年之后有人另写一本书，引用更有力的证据，把整个结论给改变了。有时候你会赞同这个新结论，有时候你会反对。有时候你必须从几本书的几个不同结论中判断哪个才是最靠谱的。有时候你会觉得他们说的其实都不对，只有你知道正确答案。到了这个层次，你已经跟书的作者完全平等了。你甚至可以俯视他们，评判他们之间的高下。这时候你又应该怎么办？写篇文章发表出来！</p><p>好书之所以要读两遍，最重要的目的就是为了这些心得、灵感和联系。对一本讲我们不太熟悉的领域的书，在第一次读的时候，我们往往会陷入作者的思想之中，我们大脑的全部带宽都被用于理解作者的思想，而没有更多的余地去产生别的想法了。「幽默是智力过剩的体现」，想法也只在带宽过剩的时候才会冒出来。只有当你读第二遍的时候，你才能气定神闲地发表意见。第一遍读是为了陷进去，第二遍读是为了跳出来。记笔记是对一本好书最大的敬意。读书笔记是一种非常个性化的写作，是个人知识的延伸。它不是书评，它完全是写给自己而不是为了公开发表的——可以完全专注于意思，而不必关心文笔。虽是这样，阅读别人写得好的读书笔记仍然是一种乐趣，而且直接读笔记可以节省大量的阅读时间（豆瓣网有个专门的系统让读者分享笔记）。</p><p>如果做不到强力研读的笔记标准，随便做个一般水平的读书笔记对自己也有帮助，最起码能加深记忆力。曾经有一个研究[^这个研究发表在2011年1月的《科学》杂志，参见科学松鼠会的报道《写文章也许能提高记忆效率》http:/songshuhui.net/archives/50079]，让受试者阅读一篇科学类文章，然后分三组：第一组多读几遍，第二组针对此文画个“概念图”，第三组用十分钟时间写篇相关文章。一周以后测试，结果发现：写文章的这组记忆的成果，甚至这时候再让他们画概念图的成果，都胜过其他两组。画概念图的效果甚至还不如多读几遍。所以“眼过千遍不如手过一遍”这句话是对的，而且用思维导图做笔记真的没用。</p><h4 id="电子书"><a href="#电子书" class="headerlink" title="电子书"></a>电子书</h4><p>我们前面说过，读得慢，效果才好。慢不一定是主动的，如果阅读介质有问题——比如字体的太小，有些字词看不清或者不认识——它们将强迫你慢下来，就是这样也有一样的好效果。有实验表明，当考试试卷印刷效果很差的时候，学生反而能更认真地对待试题而减少错误。</p><p>可能是因为更美观，可能是因为拿在手里感觉更庄重更正式，也可能是因为纸张的成本高造成文字价值也高的错觉，一般人看纸质书的速度比看电子书慢。Kindle、iPad和手机上的各种电子阅读器，把阅读体验变得无比廉价和方便，简直是鼓励人们快读。人们通常认为看纸质书比看电子书好。实际上，我们即使在网上看到好文章有时候也爱打印下来仔细研读。修改自己写的论文，更要进行多次打印。关键是印在纸上的实体文字似乎更能刺激大脑神经，让我们以更加积极的态度阅读。</p><p>但电子书也有电子书的好处。对我来说电子阅读器最重要的好处是可以自动抽取你的批注和你在书中画的重点。Kindle、iBooks和Good Reader都有这样的功能，抽取出来的内容可以直接存为一个文件，你只要直接对这个文件进行整理就得到了读书笔记，而不必随时翻书了。</p><p>读电子书一定要多批注，不要浪费那无限的空白处。如果费马当初读的是一本电子书，他大概就不会因为书的空白处太小写不下而不给出费马大定理的证明了吧。电子书发展的一个可能方向是把阅读社会化，Kindle上现在可以显示被读者高亮最多的句子，也许将来可以显示每句话上每个读者的批注。</p><h4 id="读书人的武功"><a href="#读书人的武功" class="headerlink" title="读书人的武功"></a>读书人的武功</h4><p>世界上有很多比读书重要的事。在做事和读书之间，做事优先。但读书是除实践外迅速积累见识的最好办法。在电视出现以前，人们无事可做的时候最主要的活动就是读书。现代人因为有洗衣机、洗碗机这些自动化设备，每天空闲时间比过去多得多，可是人们把大部分认知剩余都奉献给电视了。而电视这个东西从根本上就是面向尽可能多的大众的，就如同广场上的集体舞。读书人不屑于广场舞，我们追求的是武功。</p><p>强力研读要求慢读，但是我们知道很多著名的读书人的读书速度却都很快，这是为什么呢？这就是武功。他们读得快，是因为对他们来说一般的书里，新东西已经非常有限了。</p><p>我最佩服的读书人是经济学家泰勒·科文（Tyler Cowen）[^你是否记得，本书前面那篇《上网能避免浅薄吗？》中提到的《达蜜经济学》一书，就是他写的。读书多了就会发现很多东西是有联系的。]。科文是一位“著名”经济学家，他在各大报刊发表对当前经济问题的看法，写过很多书。但更著名的也许是他读书的速度！他一晚上能看好几本书。亲眼目睹他看书的人都会产生一种特别敬畏的情绪：翻书速度非常快，他看一页书的速度几乎是别人看一个标题的速度。你可能会觉得这么看肯定没看进去什么，但是我整天在看他的博客，我可以负责地说：他的确知道读过的每本书的关键之处。</p><p>科文的秘密是什么？他专门写过一篇博客文章[^http:/marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2006/12/how_to_read_fas.html]回答这个问题。他说：</p><blockquote><p>The best way to read quickly is to read lots. And lots. And to have started a long time ago. Then maybe you know what is coming in the current book.</p></blockquote><p>关键是你之前已经读过很多，很多书。而且你必须很久以前就开始读书了。这样当你读眼前这本新书的时候，你可以在相当的程度上预计作者在说什么。也许一个故事他刚开个头你就知道结局，也许很多理论你早就知道而不必再听作者讲一遍。你可以快速跳过很多基本内容，直达作者的新思想。真正资深的读者，读同一领域内的书肯定是越读越快。他们能够一眼就发现新的东西，抓住重点，知道这本书在这一领域内是个什么位置，做出了什么新贡献。</p><p>一般人都是读小说比较快，读非小说因为总要停下来所以读得比较慢。但科文读非小说的速度比读小说快！因为非小说的内容可以跳，而小说情节没法跳，跳过去就没意思了。科文还倾向于看纸质的非小说，电子书阅读器只用来读小说：因为电子书翻页不够快！</p><blockquote><p>我读的书少，远远没有达到这样的功力。不过读过若干本之后，我的读书水平似乎也提高了一点。一个表现是现在对于技术含量不是很高的书我尽量采取听有声书的办法“阅读”。英文世界几乎每一本达到一定销量的书都有有声版。我每天上下班分别要开半个小时的车，正好用来听书。</p><p>我停车之后几乎从不立即下车。我打开手机中的印象笔记应用，对着耳机线把刚刚听过的这段书的笔记录下来。找到时间，我再把这些录音笔记录整理成文字。</p><p>我只听一遍。三十分钟的书，我的录音通常只有三分钟到五分钟。其中只有原书的精华才会被我复述在录音之中，剩下的是我的心得和评论。</p></blockquote><p>整天这么读书，岂不是成了「两脚书橱」了吗？如果你认为我是「两脚书橱」，我会深感荣幸，但我认为远远不够。微博有传言说，2013年比尔·盖茨一共读了139本书，我没有办法证实这一点，但他的博客上[^盖茨的2013推荐书单：<a href="http://www.gatesnotes.com/About-Bill-Gates/Best-Books-2013]%E7%9A%84%E7%A1%AE%E8%B0%88%E8%AE%BA%E4%BA%86%E5%BE%88%E5%A4%9A%E4%B9%A6%EF%BC%8C%E8%80%8C%E4%B8%94%E4%BB%96%E8%AF%BB%E7%9A%84%E5%A4%A7%E9%83%A8%E5%88%86%E6%98%AF%E9%9D%9E%E5%B0%8F%E8%AF%B4%E3%80%82%E6%9F%A5%E7%90%86%C2%B7%E8%8A%92%E6%A0%BC%E5%92%8C%E6%B2%83%E4%BC%A6%C2%B7%E5%B7%B4%E8%8F%B2%E7%89%B9%E9%83%BD%E6%98%AF%E6%89%8B%E4%B8%8D%E9%87%8A%E5%8D%B7%E7%9A%84%E8%AF%BB%E4%B9%A6%E4%BA%BA%EF%BC%8C%E5%B7%B4%E8%8F%B2%E7%89%B9%E6%9B%B4%E5%8F%B7%E7%A7%B0%E6%98%AF%E9%86%92%E7%9D%80%E7%9A%84%E6%97%B6%E5%80%99%E6%9C%89%E4%B8%80%E5%8D%8A%E6%97%B6%E9%97%B4%E6%98%AF%E5%9C%A8%E7%9C%8B%E4%B9%A6%E3%80%82%E8%8A%92%E6%A0%BC%E8%AF%B4[^%E3%80%8A%E7%A9%B7%E6%9F%A5%E7%90%86%E5%AE%9D%E5%85%B8%E3%80%8B%EF%BC%8C%E6%9D%8E%E7%BB%A7%E5%AE%8F%E8%AF%91%E3%80%82%E8%BF%99%E6%9C%AC%E4%B9%A6%E6%98%AF%E6%9F%A5%E7%90%86%C2%B7%E8%8A%92%E6%A0%BC%E7%9A%84%E6%BC%94%E8%AE%B2%E9%9B%86%E3%80%82]%EF%BC%9A">http://www.gatesnotes.com/About-Bill-Gates/Best-Books-2013]的确谈论了很多书，而且他读的大部分是非小说。查理·芒格和沃伦·巴菲特都是手不释卷的读书人，巴菲特更号称是醒着的时候有一半时间是在看书。芒格说[^《穷查理宝典》，李继宏译。这本书是查理·芒格的演讲集。]：</a></p><blockquote><p>我这辈子遇到的聪明人（来自各行各业的聪明人）没有不每天阅读的——没有，一个都没有。沃伦读书之多，我读书之多，可能会让你感到吃惊。我的孩子们都笑话我。他们觉得我是一本长了两条腿的书。</p></blockquote><p>[^The-Summers-Most-Unread-Book]: The Summers Most Unread Book Is … by JORDAN ELLENBERG, July 3,2014, WSJ.<br>[^当时是2009年，现在修改此文的时候，该页面上又有了几篇新的书评，这些书评写的仍然不靠谱。]: 当时是2009年，现在修改此文的时候，该页面上又有了几篇新的书评，这些书评写的仍然不靠谱。<br>[^How-to-Read-A-Book]: How to Read a Book by Mortimer J.
